- 👋 Hi, I’m @BeeyWasser (Amanda Yuna)
- 👀 I’m interested in exact sciences in general, such as programming, mathematics, science, robotics, biology and with the exception of philosophy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Git and pygame.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on large applied projects and with different organizations with flexibility and innovation. But also with interesting people in the STEAM and STEM areas.
- 📫 How to reach me through my Discord and GitHub.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Some people don't like the applicability of JavaScript to their codes, or simply don't see much use in it beyond the interaction feature. But it was one of the first languages ​​I learned to program, in addition to web development.
